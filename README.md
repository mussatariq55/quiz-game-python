# ❓ Quiz Game

A fully functional command-line **True/False quiz game** built in Python using **Object-Oriented Programming**.  
This project allows users to answer a series of trivia questions and tracks their score in real time.

🧠 Designed to be clean, modular, and extendable — powered by custom classes like `Question`, `QuizBrain`, and a data-driven approach.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 Multiple modules for clean separation of logic (`question_model.py`, `quiz_brain.py`, `data.py`)
- 🔁 Dynamic question loop based on remaining questions
- ✅ Real-time answer validation and score tracking
- 👓 Final score display on game completion
- 🎨 ASCII art logo for a fun CLI experience
- 💡 Built using OOP principles: classes, instances, encapsulated logic

---

## 📁 Project Structure

1. main.py - Main game controller
2. question_model.py - Question class (blueprint for each quiz item)
3. quiz_brain.py - Core quiz logic (loop, scoring, validation)
4. data.py - Trivia data bank (text + answers)
5. art.py - ASCII logo


---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure multi-file Python projects
- Building and instantiating custom classes (`Question`, `QuizBrain`)
- Managing user input and validation through control flows
- Using lists and loops to iterate dynamic quiz logic
- Returning and comparing data cleanly using OOP methods

---

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Place all files (main.py, quiz_brain.py, question_model.py, data.py, art.py) in the same directory.
3. Run the app: python main.py
